# Instaparse Demo

This is the code from my presentation on [Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) at the [Friendly Functional Programming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Friendly-Functional-Programming-Meetup-Berlin/events/266116776/).

To play with Instaparse in your browser I recommend [Instaparse Live](http://instaparse-live.matt.is).
